# REX-goldenrod
## Introduction ##
R scripts from the Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site Rain Exclusion eXperiment (KBS-LTER REX).

These scripts are used to organize, clean, analyze, and plot data from the individual goldenrod stems collected in 2021 & 2022.

### Response variables include: ###
- stem biomass
- stem height
- seed production and biomass
- gall measurements (biomass, larval chamber size and count)

## Workflow: ##
The associated L1 data must be downloaded prior to running the R script for each variable. Each response variable typically has its own R script for cleaning (L1) and analysis/plotting (L2). Some traits (e.g. seed production and biomass) are grouped for L2 analysis and figure-making scripts.

## Location of data: ##
The L1 data assocaited with this repository are available in an EDI package (in prep).

## Spatiotemporal extent: ##
- Spatial extent: Kellogg Biological Station Long Term Ecological Research site (KBS-LTER), Hickory Corners, MI, USA. All data were collected in the early successional (T7) field replicates. This data occurs within the Rain Exclusion eXperiment (REX) plots (referred to as footprints in the scripts).
- Temporal extent: end of growing season (September - October) 2021 & 2022

## Usage: ##
All analyses were conducted using R (R Core Team 2024)

### File naming convention: ###
- Data files: File names typically contain KBS-LTER treatment code (T7), project within the greater Rain Exclusion eXperiment or REX (warmx), plant identifier (soca - Solidago canadensis), response variable, and data stage identifier. Some may include the greater project identifier "REX".
- Scripts: Scripts are seperated into two folders: L1 and L2. L1 scripts use raw data and clean it, resulting in the cleaned L1 data in the EDI package. The L2 scripts take the cleaned data and analyze/plot it. The scripts are named with respect to their response variable, and contain code for both statistical analysis and figure making.
- Column headers: Data files typically contain the following identifier columns: treatment (KBS LTER treatment code), rep (field replicate number), plot identifier (called "footprint"), subplot identifier (A-D), climate treatment (ambient, ambient drought, warm, warm drought), stem galling status (galled/non-galled), year (2021/2022), and unique plant ID. If a file is missing any identifier information, the unique plant ID and year can be used to merge identifier information.

## Scripts: ##
### L1 ###
L1 scripts use raw data and clean it, resulting in the cleaned L1 data in the EDI package. We do not currently have raw L0 data available in our EDI pacakge, but it may be available upon reasonable request.

All L1 scripts are cleaning scripts. Some may include "clean" in the file name (e.g. gall_vol_clean_L1.R).

### L2 ### 
The L2 scripts take the cleaned data and analyze/plot it. The scripts are named with respect to their response variable, and contain code for both statistical analysis and figure making.

*file name incoming* is an optional cleaning script that unifies some metadata columns across all L1 files. This includes adding year columns to datasets that don't have them, capitalizing all subplot letters, and renaming the LTER treatment column to the standardized T7. This is an optional script, and does not affect any figures or analyses.
